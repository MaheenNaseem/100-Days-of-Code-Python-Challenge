# Project: Turtle Race
## Description
- Created an interactive Turtle Race Game using Python's turtle graphics module
- Added a color betting system where users guess the winning turtle.
- Implemented robust input validation to ensure correct color input and re-prompts on wrong input.
- Dynamically generated turtle racers with unique colors and positions.
- Used random speeds to simulate a fair race.
- Displays a winner or loser message after the race ends.
- Program auto-closes the screen after race completion.
- Enhanced case-insensitive input handling for better user experience.

## Differences from Angela Yu's Version
- Added input validation loop to reject invalid or non-color inputs.
- Enhanced case-insensitive color matching.
- Turtle placement and race logic followed the original structure.
- Used screen.bye() to auto-close after the winner is announced.
