# Day 22: Build Pong: The Famous Arcade Game

## How Game works:
- This is a two-player game, right paddle uses arrow keys, and left paddle uses "awsd" keys
- If the ball hits the top or bottom walls, it bounces back
- If the paddle hits the ball, it will bounce in the opponent's direction
- If the paddle misses the ball, the opponent will gain a point, with the ball moving towards the opponent
- Each time the ball hits the paddle, the ball's speed is increased
- Right now, the game is infinite (setting levels with quick achievement of a certain number of points would remedy that)
  
## Execution Steps:
1. Set up the Main Screen
2. Create a Paddle that responds to Key Presses
3. Write the Paddle Class and Create the Second Paddle
4. Write the Ball Class and Make the Ball Move
5. Add the Ball Bouncing Logic
6. How to Detect Collisions with the Paddle
7. How to Detect when the Ball Goes Out of Bounds
8. Score Keeping and Changing the Ball Speed
