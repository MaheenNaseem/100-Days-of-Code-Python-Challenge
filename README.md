# 👋 Hello, I'm Maheen!
Welcome to my #100DaysOfCode Python Challenge repository. This space is dedicated to documenting my daily coding journey, from learning the basics of Python to advanced projects.

# 🚀 About This Challenge
This challenge is inspired by Angela Yu’s "100 Days of Python" Bootcamp. The main goals are:
- 📚 Daily Python practice — from syntax basics to advanced concepts.
- 🛠️ Hands-on projects & coding exercises.
- 📊 Progress tracking via daily GitHub commits.
- ✍️ Documenting my learning, mistakes, and growth.

# Each day's folder contains:
- `.py` Source Code
