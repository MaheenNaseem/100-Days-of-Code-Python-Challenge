# 100-Days-of-Code-Python-Challlenge

🐍 100 Days of Code: Python Projects This repository contains all the projects and exercises I'm building as I work through the 100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp by Dr. Angela Yu on Udemy. The goal of this repo is to document my progress, practice writing clean code, and keep all my mini-projects in one place for easy reference and reflection.

So far, some of the projects include:

Treasure Island Adventure Game
Rock Paper Scissors (User vs Computer)
Password Generator
I'm actively learning and pushing updates as I complete each day.

🙌 Acknowledgment All projects and exercises are based on Angela Yu’s 100 Days of Code: Python Bootcamp on Udemy. I’m grateful for the hands-on approach and engaging content — it’s been a fun way to learn Python!
